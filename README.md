## Overview

I took this challenge to practice using the ReactJs Framework NextJs. I used the NextJs docs by mainly following the
following tutorial [Create your nextjs app](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
